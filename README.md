# Design Our Own CPU

# Title : ISA Design

Consider ourself as a computer architect and we employed in a vendor company. The company told us that they are going to design a new 16 bit RISC type of CPU. As an ISA designer our job was to propose a detail design of the ISA.

# Title : Assembler    

It was difficult and error-prone to manually write machine code. The problem can be addressed by writing an assembler, which can automatically generate a machine code from an assembly file. In this project,we wrote  an assembler for our ISA. The assembler reads a program written using assembly language in a text file, then translates it into binary code and generates output file(.txt) containing machine code. The generated output files will later be useful to run a program when we will develop our actual CPU. 

# Title: Datapath 

In this part of the project, we hadto design a Datapath of your proposed 10-bit architecture. Datapath must have all the necessary components. The components must be adequately connected. It is not mandatory to design the control unit at this phase. We provided manual input to all the control lines. But the datapath must be fully operational for all individual instructions proposed.

# Title: Processor Testing

In this part of the project, We to demo that your processor is able to solve particular types of high-level problem sets. 3 programming problems  solved and demonstrated.
